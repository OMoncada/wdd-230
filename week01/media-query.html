            <p>Now in this thing we do rejoice; and we labor diligently to engraven these words upon plates,
                hoping that our beloved brethren and our children will receive them with thankful hearts,
                and look upon them that they may learn with joy and not with sorrow, neither with contempt,
                concerning their first aparents.</p>

            <h2>Mosiah 7:19</h2>
            <p>Therefore, lift up your heads, and rejoice, and put your atrust in bGod, in that God who was
                the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; and also, that God who cbrought the children
                of dIsrael out of the land of Egypt, and caused that they should walk through the Red
                Sea on dry ground, and fed them with fmanna that they might not perish in the wilderness;
                and many more things did he do for them.</p>
